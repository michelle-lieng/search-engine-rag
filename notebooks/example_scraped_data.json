It is a major source of jobs and industries across NSW, and many regional communities and livelihoods are formed around agricultural areas. Most of inland NSW is part of the Murray\u2013Darling Basin.

Agriculture is sensitive to extremes in weather and changes in climate. Climate change is already affecting the NSW climate in a few major ways: These impacts are likely to become more severe in the future. Future projections also suggest that: These current and future impacts affect how much food and fibre NSW can produce, and where it can be produced. Impacts to NSW\u2019s agriculture industry will have flow-on affects to families, communities and industries involved with agriculture, and to the wider NSW and Australian population that depend on the food grown in this important region. Agriculture also affects climate change by producing greenhouse gases which cause our climate to warm. Around  . The main greenhouse gases produced by agriculture are methane, carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide. NSW is ensuring the future of its agriculture industries through government policies and programs and farm management initiatives. These aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture industry and help farm owners and communities adapt to a changing climate.

We face big challenges to help the world\u2019s poorest people and ensure that everyone sees benefits from economic growth. Data and research help us understand these challenges and set priorities, share knowledge of what works, and measure progress. Climate change and food and nutrition insecurity pose two of the greatest development challenges of our time. Yet a more sustainable food system can not only heal the planet, but ensure food security for all. Today, the global agrifood system emits\u00a0 \u00a0of all emissions. Global food demand is estimated to   to feed a projected global population of   by 2050. Traditionally, the increase in food production has been linked to agricultural expansion, and unsustainable use of land and resources. This creates a vicious circle, leading to an increase in emissions.\u00a0 Food systems are the leading source of methane emissions and biodiversity loss, and they use around 70% of fresh water. If food waste were a country, it would be the third highest emitter in the world. Meanwhile, emissions from agriculture are increasing in developing countries \u2013 a worrying trend which must be reversed. Without significant climate mitigation action in the agri-food sector, the Paris Agreement goals cannot be reached. Agriculture is the primary cause of deforestation, threatening pristine ecosystems such as the Amazon and the Congo Basin. Without action, emissions from food systems will rise even further, with increasing food production. The global agrifood system must therefore deliver on multiple fronts. It must feed the world, adapt to climate change, and drastically reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. In response to these challenges, the concept of Climate-smart Agriculture (CSA) has emerged as a holistic approach to end food security and promote sustainable development while addressing climate change issues. CSA is a set of agricultural practices and technologies which simultaneously boost productivity, enhance resilience and reduce GHG emissions. Although it is built on existing agricultural knowledge, technologies, and sustainability principles, CSA is distinct in several ways. First, it has an explicit focus on addressing climate change in the agrifood system. Second, CSA systematically considers the synergies and tradeoffs that exist between productivity, adaptation, and mitigation. And third, CSA encompasses a range of practices and technologies that are tailored to specific agro-ecological conditions and socio-economic contexts including the adoption of climate-resilient crop varieties, conservation agriculture techniques, agroforestry, precision farming, water management strategies, and improved livestock management. By implementing these practices, triple win results can be achieved: 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Produce more and higher quality food without putting an additional strain on natural resources, to improve nutrition security and boost incomes, especially for   of the world\u2019s poor who live in rural areas and mainly rely on agriculture for their livelihoods. 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reduce vulnerability to droughts, pests, diseases and other climate-related risks and shocks; and improve the capacity to adapt and grow in the face of longer-term stresses like increased seasonal variability and more erratic weather patterns. 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reduce greenhouse gas emissions of the food system, avoid deforestation due to cropland expansion, and increase the carbon sequestration of plants and soils. Finally, funding for CSA needs to be increased to align available finance with the relevance of the sector. Despite causing one third of global greenhouse gas emissions, agrifood systems receive 4% of climate finance, with\u00a0only  of this going to smallholders. Current financial flows need to be realigned in order to support a sustainable agrifood system transformation. \u00a0 The World Bank has significantly scaled up its engagement and investment in climate-smart agriculture (CSA). In its   (2021- 2025),  needed to tackle the Paris Agreement. Since the adoption of the Paris Agreement, the World Bank has increased financing for CSA by eight times, to almost $3 billion annually.

Furthermore, all projects are screened for climate and disaster risks. Climate change indicators are used to measure outputs and outcomes, and greenhouse gas accounting of projects is conducted prior to approval .

There are over two million farms in the United States, and more than half the nation\u2019s land is used for agricultural production.  The number of farms has been slowly declining since the 1930s,  though the average farm size has remained about the same since the early 1970s.  Agriculture also extends beyond farms. It includes industries such as food service and food manufacturing.  Since early 2020, the U.S. Southwest has been experiencing one of the most severe long-term droughts of the past 1,200 years. Multiple seasons of record low precipitation and near-record high temperatures were the main triggers of the drought.   Some tribal communities are particularly vulnerable to wildfires due to their often-remote locations and lack of firefighting resources and staff.   In addition, because wildfire smoke can travel long distances from the source fire, its effects can be far reaching, especially for people with certain medical conditions or who spend long periods of time outside.  Rising temperatures and carbon dioxide concentrations may increase some crop yields, but the yields of major commodity crops (such as corn, rice, and oats) are expected to be lower than they would in a future without climate change.  Dairy cows are especially sensitive to heat stress, which can affect their appetite and milk production. In 2010, heat stress lowered annual U.S. dairy production by an estimated $1.2 billion.  Heavy rainfalls can lead to more soil erosion, which is a major environmental threat to sustainable crop production. Agriculture is very sensitive to weather and climate.  It also relies heavily on land, water, and other natural resources that climate affects. \u00a0 While climate changes (such as in temperature, precipitation, and frost timing) could   or allow different crops to be grown in some regions,  it will also make agricultural practices more difficult in others. The effects of climate change on agriculture will depend on the rate and severity of the change, as well as the degree to which farmers and ranchers can adapt.

Key impacts are described in this section. Climate change can make conditions better or worse for growing crops in different regions. For example, changes in temperature, rainfall, and frost-free days are leading to longer growing seasons in almost every state.  \u00a0A longer growing season can have both positive and negative impacts for raising food. Some farmers may be able to plant longer-maturing crops or more crop cycles altogether, while others may need to provide more irrigation over a longer, hotter growing season. Air pollution may also damage crops, plants, and forests.  \u00a0For example, when plants absorb large amounts of ground-level ozone, they experience reduced photosynthesis, slower growth, and higher sensitivity to diseases.  \u00a0 Climate change can also increase the threat of  . Wildfires pose major risks to farmlands, grasslands, and rangelands. \u00a0Temperature and precipitation changes will also very likely expand the occurrence and range of insects, weeds, and diseases.  \u00a0This could lead to a greater need for weed and pest control. \u00a0 Pollination is vital to more than 100 crops grown in the United States.  \u00a0Warmer temperatures and changing precipitation can affect when plants bloom and when  , such as bees and butterflies, come out.  \u00a0If mismatches occur between when plants flower and when pollinators emerge, pollination could decrease. Climate change is expected to increase the frequency of   in the United States, which can harm crops by eroding soil and depleting soil nutrients.  \u00a0Heavy rains can also increase agricultural   into oceans, lakes, and streams.  \u00a0This runoff can harm water quality.\u00a0 When coupled with warming water temperatures brought on by climate change, runoff can lead to depleted oxygen levels in water bodies. This is known as  . Hypoxia can kill fish and shellfish. It can also affect their ability to find food and habitat, which in turn could harm the coastal societies and economies that depend on those ecosystems. \u00a0 Sea level rise and storms also pose threats to coastal agricultural communities. These threats include erosion, agricultural land losses, and saltwater intrusion, which can contaminate water supplies.  \u00a0Climate change is expected to worsen these threats. \u00a0 Agricultural workers face several climate-related health risks. These include exposures to heat and other extreme weather, more pesticide exposure due to expanded pest presence, disease-carrying pests like mosquitos and ticks, and degraded air quality.  \u00a0Language barriers, lack of health care access, and other factors can compound these risks.  \u00a0Heat and humidity can also affect the health and productivity of animals raised for meat, milk, and eggs.  \u00a0\u00a0 For more specific examples of climate change impacts in your region, please see the  . Agriculture contributed more than $1.1 trillion to the U.S. gross domestic product in 2019.  \u00a0The sector accounts for 10.9 percent of total U.S. employment\u2014more than 22 million jobs.  \u00a0These include not only on-farm jobs, but also jobs in food service and other related industries. Food service makes up the largest share of these jobs at 13 million.  \u00a0 Cattle, corn, dairy products, and soybeans are the  .  \u00a0The United States is also a key exporter of soybeans, other plant products, tree nuts, animal feeds, beef, and veal. Many hired crop   are foreign-born people from Mexico and Central America.  \u00a0Most hired crop farmworkers are not migrant workers; instead, they work at a single location within 75 miles of their homes.  \u00a0Many hired farmworkers can be more at risk of climate health threats due to social factors, such as language barriers and health care access. Climate change could affect food security for some households in the country. Most U.S. households are currently  . This means that all people in the household have enough food to live active, healthy lives.  \u00a0However, 13.8 million U.S. households (about one-tenth of all U.S. households) were food insecure at least part of the time in 2020.  \u00a0U.S. households with above-average   include those with an income below the poverty threshold, those headed by a single woman, and those with Black or Hispanic owners and lessees. Climate change can also affect food security for some Indigenous peoples in Hawai'i and other U.S.-affiliated Pacific islands. Climate impacts like sea level rise and more intense storms can affect the production of crops like taro, breadfruit, and mango.  These crops are often key sources of nutrition and may also have cultural and economic importance.
